# Sparkle Party Lesson One

Duplicate the Sparkle_Party.java file. Rename the file by adding your name, ex: Khloe_Sparkle_Party.java

Work through these tasks in order to upgrade your `Sparkle_Party.java` file to finish bringing our light bar online.

---

## ☐ Task 1: Update the OpMode Name & Filename
**What to do:**
- Change the `@Autonomous` annotation to include your name
- Example: `@Autonomous(name="YourName: Sparkle Party", group="Iterative Opmode")`

**Where:** Just above the class declaration

---

## ☐ Task 2: Add Additional Servo Declarations
**What to do:**
- Add 5 more servo variables to your class (you currently only have `led0`)
- Add: `led1`, `led2`, `led3`, `led4`, and `led5`

**Where:** In the "Declare OpMode members" section at the top of your class

**Hint:** Follow the same pattern as your existing `private Servo led0;` declaration

---

## ☐ Task 3: Initialize All Six Servos
**What to do:**
- In your `init()` method, add hardware mapping for all 6 servos
- Use `hardwareMap.get(Servo.class, "NAME")` for each one
- Servo names should be: "ledZero", "ledOne", "ledTwo", "ledThree", "ledFour", "ledFive"

**Where:** In the `init()` method

**Current:** You only initialize `led0`
**Goal:** Initialize all 6 servos

---

## ☐ Task 4: Create the Alternating Pattern Variables
**What to do:**
- Replace your single `ledPosition` variable with TWO new variables:
    - `ledPositionEven` (for servos 0, 2, 4)
    - `ledPositionOdd` (for servos 1, 3, 5)

**Where:** In the "Declare OpMode members" section

**Why:** This allows you to create an alternating color pattern where even and odd LEDs show different colors

---

## ☐ Task 5: Update Your Color Timing Logic
**What to do:**
- Modify each `if/else if` block in your `loop()` method to set BOTH variables:
    - `ledPositionEven = [value];`
    - `ledPositionOdd = [value];`
- Choose different values for even and odd to create complementary color pairs

**Where:** In the `loop()` method

**Example:**
```java
if (seconds < 2.0) {
    ledPositionEven = 0.388;  // yellow on even LEDs
    ledPositionOdd = 0.611;   // blue on odd LEDs
}
```

---

## ☐ Task 6: Set Positions for All Six Servos
**What to do:**
- At the end of your `loop()` method, add `setPosition()` calls for all 6 servos
- Even-numbered servos (0, 2, 4) should use `ledPositionEven`
- Odd-numbered servos (1, 3, 5) should use `ledPositionOdd`

**Where:** At the end of the `loop()` method (after telemetry)

**Pattern:**
```java
led0.setPosition(ledPositionEven);
led1.setPosition(ledPositionOdd);
// ... continue for all 6
```

---

## ☐ Task 7: Update Telemetry Output
**What to do:**
- Update your telemetry to display both LED position variables
- Add a line for `ledPositionEven`
- Add a line for `ledPositionOdd`

**Where:** In the `loop()` method

**Hint:** You can copy the existing telemetry line and modify it

---

## ☐ Task 8: Add Helpful Comments
**What to do:**
- Add comments explaining what your code does
- Focus on the trickier parts like the timing logic and alternating patterns
- Look at Khloe's comments for inspiration!

**Where:** Throughout your code

**Bonus:** Explaining code in your own words helps you understand it better!

## Testing Checklist
Once you've completed all tasks:
- [ ] Does your code compile without errors?
- [ ] Are all 6 servos declared and initialized?
- [ ] Do you have both `ledPositionEven` and `ledPositionOdd` variables?
- [ ] Does your `loop()` method set both variables in each time period?
- [ ] Are all 6 servos receiving position commands?
- [ ] Have you tested it on the robot?

## Challenge: Customize Your Light Show!
After completing all the above tasks, try these enhancements:
- Change the timing intervals to match a song
- Create your own custom color sequences
- Add a third pattern for even more variety
